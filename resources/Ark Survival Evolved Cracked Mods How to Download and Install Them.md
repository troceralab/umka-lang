# How to Install Mods for Ark: Survival Evolved (Cracked Version)
 
Ark: Survival Evolved is a popular survival game that lets you explore a vast open world filled with dinosaurs and other creatures. You can also customize your game experience with mods, which are user-created modifications that add new features, items, maps, and more. However, if you are playing a cracked version of Ark: Survival Evolved, you might encounter some difficulties in installing mods. In this article, we will show you how to download and install mods for Ark: Survival Evolved (cracked version) using some tools and tricks.
 
## Step 1: Download Ark Mod Downloader
 
The first thing you need to do is to download a tool called Ark Mod Downloader, which can help you download mods from the Steam Workshop without having a Steam account. You can find the link to download Ark Mod Downloader in the description of this video[^1^]. After downloading the tool, extract it to a folder of your choice.

## Step 2: Find and Download Mods
 
Next, you need to find and download the mods that you want to install for Ark: Survival Evolved. You can browse the Steam Workshop for Ark: Survival Evolved and copy the URL of the mod page that you want to download. Then, open Ark Mod Downloader and paste the URL in the text box. Click on "Download" and wait for the mod to be downloaded. You can repeat this process for as many mods as you want.
 
## Step 3: Apply AppID Patch
 
After downloading the mods, you need to apply a patch that will allow them to work with your cracked version of Ark: Survival Evolved. You can find the link to download the AppID patch in the description of this video[^1^]. After downloading the patch, extract it to your Ark: Survival Evolved installation folder. Then, run the patch as administrator and click on "Patch". This will create a file called "steam\_appid.txt" in your Ark: Survival Evolved folder.
 
## Step 4: Install Mods
 
Finally, you need to install the mods that you downloaded. To do this, you need to copy the mod folders from your Ark Mod Downloader folder to your Ark: Survival Evolved installation folder. The mod folders should have names like "346110" or "764755314". You should paste them in a subfolder called "ShooterGame/Content/Mods" inside your Ark: Survival Evolved folder. If the Mods folder does not exist, create it yourself.
 
## Step 5: Activate Mods
 
The last step is to activate the mods that you installed. To do this, you need to edit a file called "GameUserSettings.ini" in your Ark: Survival Evolved installation folder. Open the file with a text editor and look for a line that says "[/Script/ShooterGame.ShooterGameUserSettings]". Under this line, add another line that says "ActiveMods=modid1;modid2;modid3;..." where modid1, modid2, modid3, etc. are the numbers of the mods that you want to activate. You can find these numbers in the names of the mod folders that you copied earlier. For example, if you want to activate a mod called "Structures Plus", which has a folder name of "764755314", you should add "ActiveMods=764755314" under "[/Script/ShooterGame.ShooterGameUserSettings]". Save and close the file.
