It was used by countless artists and producers across genres, from Madonna to Metallica, from U2 to Enya, from Quincy Jones to Brian Eno. The 480L was known for its lush and spacious sound, its versatile and creative algorithms, and its distinctive fader-driven remote control, called the LARC[^2^].

The Lexicon 480L offered four main reverb algorithms: Random Hall, Ambience, Rich Plate, and Room. Each algorithm had its own character and parameters, allowing users to shape the reverb size, decay, diffusion, modulation, and more. The 480L also featured two unique algorithms that were not strictly reverbs: Effects and Twin Delay. The Effects algorithm provided a range of time-varying effects such as reverse, doubling, tremolo, and chorus. The Twin Delay algorithm offered four independent delay lines with feedback and cross-feedback options[^2^].
 
The Lexicon 480L was not only a reverb unit, but also a digital effects system that could transform any sound source into something new and exciting. It was a staple of many studios for more than 30 years, and its legacy can still be heard on countless records today. Now, thanks to Universal Audio and DRPatje, you can experience the legendary sound of the Lexicon 480L in your own computer.
  
While the Lexicon 480L is a legendary piece of hardware, it is not easy to find or afford nowadays. Fortunately, there are several software plugins that aim to emulate its sound and features, such as the Lexicon Lx480 Lite. However, how does the Lx480 Lite compare to the original 480L and other plugins that claim to recreate its magic?
 
One of the most popular and acclaimed plugins that emulates the Lexicon 480L is the Relab LX480 Complete. This plugin offers a faithful reproduction of the original device, with all four reverb algorithms, plus two enhanced versions with more parameters and modulation options. The Relab LX480 Complete also features two independent reverb engines that can be used in parallel or serial mode, allowing for complex and creative reverb combinations[^2^].
 
The Relab LX480 Complete is widely regarded as one of the best reverb plugins on the market, and many users claim that it sounds very close to the real hardware. However, it is also quite expensive and CPU-intensive, which might be a drawback for some users. That's where the Lexicon Lx480 Lite comes in handy. The Lx480 Lite is a stripped-down version of the Relab LX480 Complete, with fewer parameters and presets, but still offering the same four reverb algorithms and high-quality sound. The Lx480 Lite is also much cheaper and lighter on CPU than the Complete edition, making it more accessible and affordable[^1^].
 
The Lexicon Lx480 Lite might not have all the bells and whistles of the Relab LX480 Complete, but it still delivers a great emulation of the Lexicon 480L sound. It can produce lush and spacious reverbs that can enhance any mix, from vocals to drums, from guitars to synths. It is also easier to use and more intuitive than the original hardware or the Complete edition, thanks to its simplified interface and fewer controls. The Lx480 Lite is a great option for users who want a classic reverb sound without breaking the bank or their CPU.
