## How to Cheat in It's Quiz Time
 
If you want to have an edge over your opponents in It's Quiz Time, you might be tempted to cheat. There are a few ways you can do this, depending on the game mode and the device you are using.
 
### Cheating with Your Smartphone
 
One of the unique features of It's Quiz Time is that you can use your smartphone as a controller. You can download the It's Quiz Time: Companion App on iOS or Android[^3^] and connect it to the game via Wi-Fi. This allows you to take selfies, hide your answers, bluff, tap and swipe your way to victory. However, it also opens up some possibilities for cheating.

- You can use another device or browser to look up the answers online while playing. Just make sure you are discreet and fast enough to avoid suspicion.
- You can communicate with another player who knows the answers and get them to tell you what to choose. You can use text messages, voice calls, or even hand signals if they are nearby.
- You can hack or modify the app to give you more time, points, or correct answers. However, this might require some technical skills and tools that are beyond the scope of this article.

### Cheating with Your Controller
 
If you are playing with a regular controller on your console or PC, you might have fewer options for cheating. However, there are still some ways you can try:
