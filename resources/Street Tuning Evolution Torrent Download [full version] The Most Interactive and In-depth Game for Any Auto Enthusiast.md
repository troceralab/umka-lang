## What is a torrent site and how does it work?
 
A torrent site is a website that hosts files that can be downloaded using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A P2P network is a system where users share files with each other without relying on a central server. To download a file from a torrent site, you need a special software called a torrent client, such as BitTorrent or uTorrent. A torrent client connects you to other users who have the same file or parts of it, and downloads it from them. This way, you can get large files faster and without using too much bandwidth.
