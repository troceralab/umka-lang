Yui Ogura and IU are not the only singers who look like each other. There are many other cases of celebrity doppelgangers, especially in the Asian entertainment industry. For example, some people think that Japanese actress and singer Haruka Ayase looks like Korean actress Song Hye Kyo, or that Chinese actress and singer Yang Mi looks like Korean actress Park Shin Hye.
 
Some of these lookalikes are aware of their similarities and have even met each other in person. For instance, Yui Ogura and IU have both attended the same music awards show in Japan, and have exchanged greetings and compliments. They have also expressed their admiration for each other's work on social media.
 
However, some lookalikes are not so friendly with each other. There have been cases of plagiarism accusations and lawsuits between celebrities who look alike. For example, Korean singer Jang Na Ra sued Chinese singer Zhang Li Yin for copying her image and songs. Similarly, Korean singer G.NA sued Chinese singer Meng Jia for using her stage name and logo.
 
Whether they are friends or foes, these lookalikes certainly attract a lot of attention from fans and media. Some people enjoy finding similarities and differences between them, while others prefer to appreciate them as unique individuals. Either way, they prove that beauty comes in many forms and styles.
