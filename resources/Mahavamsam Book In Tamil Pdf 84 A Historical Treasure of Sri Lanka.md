The original Mahavamsam consists of 37 chapters, and was composed by Mahanama Thera in the 5th or 6th century CE. It was based on earlier chronicles such as Dipavamsa and Atthakatha, as well as oral traditions and inscriptions. Mahavamsam was later continued by several authors, who added chapters on the subsequent history of Sri Lanka until the 18th century CE. These continuations are known as Culavamsa.
 
Mahavamsam has been translated into several languages, including Tamil, Sinhala, English, German, French, and Dutch. The Tamil translation of Mahavamsam was done by S. Sankaran in 1962, and published by Mallikai Velieedu. The translation covers the first 37 chapters of Mahavamsam, and is available in PDF format online. The PDF file has 409 pages and is 16.5 MB in size.

CÅ«lavaá¹sa: A Continuation of Mahavamsam
 
CÅ«lavaá¹sa or Chulavamsa (Pali: "Lesser Chronicle") is a historical record that continues the Mahavamsam from the 4th century to 1815. It covers the history of Sri Lanka under various dynasties, invasions, kingdoms, and colonial powers. CÅ«lavaá¹sa was composed by several Buddhist monks over many centuries, and displays a variety of epic styles. It is generally considered to be a part of the Mahavamsam, and together they form a comprehensive chronicle of Sri Lankan history for over two millennia.
 
The CÅ«lavaá¹sa consists of three sections written by five different authors (one anonymous) belonging to successive historical periods. The first section, from chapter 38 to 79, was written by Dhammakitti Thera in the 13th century. It covers the history of Sri Lanka from the reign of Mahasena (277-304 CE) to Parakramabahu II (1236-1270 CE). The second section, from chapter 80 to 90, was written by an anonymous author in the 14th century. It covers the history of Sri Lanka from Vijayabahu IV (1270-1272 CE) to Bhuvanekabahu VI (1469-1477 CE). The third section, from chapter 91 to 101, was written by four authors: Pannasara Thera, Dhammakitti II Thera, Tibbotuvave Sumangala Thera, and Batuvantudave Medhankara Thera. They wrote in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries respectively. They cover the history of Sri Lanka from Parakramabahu VI (1477-1480 CE) to Sri Vikrama Rajasinha (1798-1815 CE), the last king of Kandy who surrendered to the British.
 
The CÅ«lavaá¹sa is a valuable source of information for the medieval and modern history of Sri Lanka. It provides details of the political, religious, cultural, and social developments of the island. It also contains accounts of foreign relations, wars, famines, epidemics, natural disasters, and other events that affected Sri Lanka. The CÅ«lavaá¹sa also reflects the views and values of its authors and their times. It shows their admiration for Buddhist kings and monks, their criticism of non-Buddhist rulers and sects, their pride in Sinhalese identity and culture, and their resistance to foreign domination.
 
The CÅ«lavaá¹sa has been translated into several languages, including English, German, French, Sinhala, and Tamil. The English translation of CÅ«lavaá¹sa was done by Wilhelm Geiger in 1929-1930, and revised by Mabel Haynes Bode in 1953. The translation covers all 101 chapters of CÅ«lavaá¹sa, and is available online at [this link](https://mahavamsa.org/mahavamsa/original-version/).
