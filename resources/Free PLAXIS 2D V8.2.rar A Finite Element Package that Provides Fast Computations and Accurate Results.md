### Benefits of PLAXIS 2D
 
PLAXIS 2D is not only a powerful and user-friendly finite element software, but also a reliable and accurate one. It offers many benefits for geotechnical engineers who want to analyze and model complex geotechnical structures. Here are some of the main benefits of PLAXIS 2D:
 
- It supports various types of soil models, such as linear elastic, Mohr-Coulomb, Hardening Soil, Soft Soil Creep and more. You can also define your own soil models using user-defined soil models (UDSM).
- It allows you to simulate various types of loading conditions, such as gravity, self-weight, surcharge, seismic, thermal and more. You can also apply dynamic loading using time histories or harmonic loading.
- It enables you to model various types of geotechnical structures, such as foundations, retaining walls, tunnels, embankments, slopes and more. You can also model complex interactions between soil and structure using interface elements.
- It provides you with various tools for post-processing and visualization of the results, such as contour plots, vector plots, graphs, tables and more. You can also export the results to other formats or software for further analysis.
- It integrates with other Bentley software, such as SoilVision for advanced soil properties and groundwater flow analysis, gINT for geotechnical data management and reporting, STAAD.Pro for structural analysis and design and more.
- It comes with a comprehensive online help system and documentation, as well as technical support and training from Bentley experts. You can also access a large community of PLAXIS users and experts through forums, blogs and webinars.
