The film is set in 1944, during the Spanish Civil War, a conflict that pitted the Republican government against the Nationalist rebels, supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The film depicts the brutality and oppression of the Francoist regime, as well as the resistance and courage of the rebels and their sympathizers. The film also shows the contrast between the harsh reality of war and the enchanting fantasy of Ofelia's imagination.
 
The film is rich in symbolism and allegory, drawing inspiration from various sources of mythology, folklore and literature. The faun, for example, is a creature from Greek and Roman mythology, associated with nature, fertility and mischief. The Pale Man, the child-eating monster, is a representation of greed and gluttony, as well as a metaphor for fascism and genocide. The mandrake root, a plant with human-like shape, is a symbol of magic and healing, but also of witchcraft and evil. The labyrinth itself is a symbol of mystery, adventure and transformation.
 
The film also uses various elements of cinematography, sound and editing to create a captivating and immersive experience for the viewers. The film uses color to differentiate between the two worlds: the real world is mostly gray, brown and blue, while the fantasy world is more colorful, with green, red and gold. The film also uses lighting to create contrast and mood: the real world is often dark, shadowy and gloomy, while the fantasy world is brighter, warmer and more inviting. The film also uses sound to enhance the atmosphere and emotion: the real world is filled with noises of war, violence and pain, while the fantasy world has sounds of nature, music and wonder. The film also uses editing to create suspense and tension: the film cuts between scenes of Ofelia's tasks and scenes of Vidal's actions, creating parallelism and contrast.
