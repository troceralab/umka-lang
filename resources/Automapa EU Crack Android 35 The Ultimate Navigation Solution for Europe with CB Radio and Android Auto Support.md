Android 35 is not a canon character, but a fan-made concept that imagines what would happen if Android 17 and Android 18 performed a fusion technique that allows two beings to merge into one. Fusion is a common theme in the Dragon Ball series, as several characters have used it to increase their power or overcome difficult situations. Fusion can be achieved by different methods, such as wearing special earrings called Potara or performing a dance called Metamoran. Android 35 is presumed to be the result of using Potara earrings, as they are compatible with any type of being.
